# learning-python

Just started to learn python, so these are just a bunch of random excercises.

I'm mainly a .NET developer, so some of the naming conventions I use are not completely along the official guidelines. For the official guidelines see https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

If you have any questions regarding the code, just create an issue.

Cheers!
